Hey Claude, I'd like to build a python program that accesses the Strava API on my behalf and get's a list of Running activities I've done over the last 12 
months.

Then the python program should group the activities by which shoes I was wearing.

Then I want to know the Average GAP (Grade Adjusted Pace) for each shoe

Please document how you will achieve this in a markdown SPEC.md file, then build this program.

If there's any details or clarifications you need from me please just pause and ask. I expect at some point you will need my credentials or an API key, please ask 
for it, if an API key please provide instructions on how I can get it. 
```
